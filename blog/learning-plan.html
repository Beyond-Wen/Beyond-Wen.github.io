          <p class="plan-question"><em>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em></p>
          <p class="blog-body">To use what I learn from the bootcamp to find employment that offers flexibility and remote-work options. </p>

          <p class="plan-question"><em>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</em></p>
          <p class="blog-body">My strengths: I am very patient. I cope well under pressure. I’m very responsible and will do my best to deliver what is expected of me.
            My limitations: My time management ability isn’t the best, and that links to all sorts of problems.</p>

          <p class="plan-question"><em>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</em></p>
          <p class="blog-body">To find reward in the face of challenges. To not get discouraged when things become difficult.</p>

          <p class="plan-question"><em>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. 
            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</em></p>
          <p class="blog-body">I will aim to communicate with others early, promptly, and with respect to figure out what is expected of me/us.
            I have been falling a little behind in these first 2 weeks of foundations due to special circumstances which have now come to an end. 
            From week 3 onwards, I will attempt to start and finish the workload earlier than expected in order not to fall behind. And if I do fall behind, I will communicate with my facilitator to figure out how to best rectify this as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p class="plan-question"><em>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</em></p>
          <p class="blog-body">I will seek help from online resources, from my facilitator, from Discord channels, and from other learners in my group.</p>

          <p class="plan-question"><em>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</em></p>
          <p class="blog-body"></class>I expect them to not be judgemental of the questions I may ask. 
            I expect them to be understanding that we all learn at different paces. 
            I also expect them to alert us when we have fallen behind.</p>

          <p class="plan-question"><em>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</em></p>
          <p class="blog-body">I don’t have any other planned commitments, although unexpected things do happen, so it’s best to do the work early in case I get busy with unexpected things.</p>
