            <h2>1.	Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <p class="plan-question"><em>o	Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.
            </em></p>
            <p class="blog-body">
              Neuroplasticity is the philosophy that our brain can be changed and shaped by our habits and experiences. 
              In other words, when we practice a new skill over and over again, 
              our brain registers this practice and actually reshapes and rewires itself to strengthen the cells responsible for this skill. 
              By knowing and understanding this principle, we can learn to move forward from defeat and stop using phrases like “I’m not a maths person” or “I’m not cut out for that”. 
              All we need is more practice.
            </p>
            <p class="plan-question"><em>o	Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
            </em></p>
            <p class="blog-body">
              This is really a new concept for me. For most of my life, I’ve accepted that I’m very good at certain things and terrible at other things. 
              Like most people, knowing I’m bad at certain things only stopped me from attempting them any further. 
              Until the beginning of this course, computer programming was one of those things that I would never have dared to attempt. 
              But now that I’m here, and having been enlightened by the principle of neuroplasticity, I have more faith in myself that I’ll get better, and I can do it, I just need lots of practice.
            </p>
            <p class="plan-question"><em>o	What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
            </em></p>
            <p class="blog-body">
              Practice, practice, practice. And when you can’t practice physically, practice mentally. Apparently it’s almost as good as the real thing.

            <h2>2.	Research Growth Mindset</h2>
            <p class="plan-question"><em>o	Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
            </em></p>
            <p class="blog-body">
              Growth Mindset is the approach to learning where we emphasise the idea of “not yet”. 
              It’s the opposite of a fixed mindset where we believe our intelligence, abilities, and talents are fixed. 
              Instead of believing or claiming that we are not good at something, we approach it with the idea that we are “not good yet”. 
              It gives us hope that perhaps with more practise and attention, we can be good one day. 
              This is directly linked to the idea of neuroplasticity where practice will help to strengthen our abilities over time.

            <p class="plan-question"><em>o	In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
            </em></p>
            <p class="blog-body">
              Although it’s a very simple idea, I do think it makes a difference. 
              I now feel more positive about learning tasks that I find difficult. 
              It’s a great mindset to approach learning.
            </p>
            <p class="plan-question"><em>o	How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
            </em></p>
            <p class="blog-body">
              When I feel stuck or like I’ve fallen behind, instead of feeling frustrated or hopeless, 
              I will remind myself of the growth mindset feel more positive about difficulties.

            <p class="plan-question"><em>o	Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.

            <h2>3.	Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
            <p class="plan-question"><em>o	Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.
            </em></p>

              The key non-technical skill I’d like to take away from this course is to not get discouraged by challenges and difficulties. 
              Too often when things become difficult, I just want to give up. 
              But hopefully incorporating Growth Mindset and the philosophy of Neuroplasticity into my process will allow me to think and react more positively in the face of obstacles.
